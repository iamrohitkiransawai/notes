To configure GitHub on your local machine so that you can push changes to a remote repository, you can use the following steps:

1. Install **Git** on your local machine by downloading the installer from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and running it.

2. `Open the Command Prompt` or `Terminal` on your local machine.

3. `Configure your Git user name and email` by running the following commands:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
```
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```
4. `Create an SSH key` by running the following command:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
This will create a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. Press enter to save the key in the default location (_usually in the user's home directory/.ssh/id_rsa_).

5. Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent by running the following command:
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
6. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard by running the following command:
```
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
7. Go to your GitHub account settings and add the copied SSH key to your account.

8. Clone the remote repository to your local machine by running the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git
```
Make the changes you want to push to the remote repository and then use the following command to push the changes:
```
git push origin <branch>
```

Note:
* Replace <username> and <repository> with the actual username and repository name of the remote repository.
* Replace <branch> with the actual branch name you want to push the changes to.
* Once you have the SSH key added to your GitHub account, you can use it to push and pull changes from any repository that belongs to that account.
